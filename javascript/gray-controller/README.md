# TECHNICAL DEMO

The difficulty of this project is obvious so I'm breaking it apart into multiple demos
This demo seeks to solve Group Abstractions

Thus

> All data will be global to ignore input/outputs

# Roadmap

(1) Shallow Groups
Create and allocate bot population into groups which perform linear tasks

(2) Conditional Logic
Groups need adapatable logic to avoid conflicting actions (EX: No more resources)

(3) Deep Groups
As the game progress further abstraction is required so groups contain groups

> Serves no purpose in demo

(4) Create Groups
Player needs to be able to add groups at runtime

(5) Editable Groups
Player needs to be able to reorganize groups at runtime
